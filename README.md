# Node Graph

Small app for building node graphs for mobile (tested on Android). Can save/load graphs to Json.

## Canvas Controls
* Tap an empty area to add a node
* Tap a selected (green) node to rename
* Drag a node to an empty area to move it
* Drag a node to another node to connect / de-connect
* Drag a node to the Trash to delete it

## Menu Options
* New - a new empty canvas
* Graph Name - set's the current graph's name
* Save - serializes the graph to json and writes to the download folder
* *graph name.txt - load the graph, replacing the current graph
* *X - delete a saved graph

## Improvements
* art

* better feedback for moving / connecting things
* multi touch support
* zooming / camera controls
* customization
